# Steam-Inventory-Appraiser-alpha
Steam Inventory Appraiser (alpha version) for Counter-Strike using Steam API.

How to use:
1. Download NodeJs
2. Install Express: `npm install express`
3. Start server: `node server.js`
4. Open `http://localhost:8080/`

This is an alpha version, so there are "funny" problems with loading prices, due to the limitation of requests to the steam servers (429 too many requests). Will be fixed in the future. xd
